**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Fixed redirect logic with state management
- `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` - Improved loading states and error handling

### 2. Network Switching Issues ✅ FIXED

**Root Cause:** Automatic network switching was confusing users and causing unnecessary complexity.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Removed automatic network switching prompts
- Simplified wallet connection to assume MegaETH testnet
- Removed chainId validation and switching logic
- Streamlined wallet context for better performance

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/wallet-connect-button.tsx` - Removed network switching UI
- `src/app/dashboard/blockchain/page.tsx` - Simplified network handling
- `src/contexts/wallet-context.tsx` - Removed chainId complexity
