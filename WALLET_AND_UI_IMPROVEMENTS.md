# Wallet Connection & Create Lab UI Improvements

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Enhanced Wallet Connection with MegaETH Integration

#### Improved Network Switching Logic
- Enhanced automatic network detection and switching to MegaETH Testnet (Chain ID: 9000)
- Added proper error handling for cases where MegaETH network is not added to wallet
- Implemented automatic network addition when switching fails due to missing network
- Added retry logic after adding the network to ensure smooth connection

#### MegaETH Network Configuration
- Chain ID: 9000 (0x2328 in hex)
- Network Name: MegaETH Testnet
- RPC URL: https://testnet.megaeth.io
- Explorer: https://www.megaexplorer.xyz/
- Native Currency: ETH (18 decimals)

#### Connection Flow
1. User clicks "Connect Wallet"
2. System detects if MetaMask/OKX/Rabby is installed
3. Requests account access
4. Validates current network
5. If not on MegaETH:
   - Attempts to switch to MegaETH
   - If network not found (error 4902), automatically adds it
   - Switches to newly added network
6. Connects wallet and displays balance

#### Wallet Persistence
- Connection state persists across page reloads
- Automatically reconnects on app startup if previously connected
- Validates network on reconnection and prompts to switch if needed

### 2. Expanded Quantum Algorithm Library

Added 5 new preset algorithms to the Create Lab:

#### New Algorithms

1. **Quantum Teleportation** (Advanced - 3 qubits)
   - Transfer quantum information using entanglement
   - Demonstrates quantum state transfer protocol

2. **Quantum Fourier Transform** (Advanced - 3 qubits)
   - Quantum signal processing essential for Shor's algorithm
   - Used in factoring and pattern detection
   - Icon: 🎵

3. **Quantum Random Generator** (Beginner - 4 qubits)
   - Generate truly random numbers using quantum mechanics
   - Produces genuinely unpredictable values
   - Icon: 🎲

4. **Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm** (Intermediate - 3 qubits)
   - Determine if a function is constant or balanced
   - Demonstrates quantum speedup over classical algorithms
   - Icon: 🎯

5. **Quantum Phase Estimation** (Advanced - 4 qubits)
   - Estimate eigenvalues for quantum systems
   - Foundation for quantum chemistry and optimization
   - Icon: 📐

#### Original Algorithms (Enhanced)
- Bell State Creation
- Grover's Search
- Quantum Superposition

Each algorithm now includes:
- Detailed description
- Explanation of what it does
- Difficulty level (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
- Number of qubits required
- Visual icon for easy identification
- Complete OpenQASM 2.0 code

### 3. UI/UX Enhancements

#### Layout Improvements
- Increased page padding from 6 to 8 units
- Added max-width container (7xl) for better readability on large screens
- Improved spacing between sections (8 to 10 units)
- Better grid layouts for algorithm cards (2 columns on md, 3 on lg)

#### Algorithm Card Design
- Cards now have equal height for consistent appearance
- Better text hierarchy with improved font sizes
- Enhanced hover effects with scale animation
- Selected cards have shadow effects for better visual feedback
- Algorithm explanations displayed as subtle italic text

#### Visual Feedback
- Smooth animations for preset selection
- Generated QASM code appears with fade-in animation
- Better color coding for difficulty levels:
  - Green for Beginner
  - Yellow for Intermediate
  - Red for Advanced
- Blue badges for qubit count

#### Information Display
- Enhanced preset selection area with better descriptions
- Improved execution estimates display
- Better provider information cards
- More spacious text areas for code input
- Read-only QASM display with monospace font

### 4. Technical Improvements

#### Type Safety
- Added TypeScript interface for PresetAlgorithm
- Ensures type consistency across the codebase
- Better IDE support and error checking

#### Error Handling
- Improved wallet connection error messages
- Better network switching error recovery
- User-friendly error descriptions

#### Code Organization
- Clean separation of concerns
- Reusable components
- Maintainable and scalable architecture

## Testing the Improvements

### Test Wallet Connection
1. Open the app in a browser with MetaMask installed
2. Click "Connect Wallet" button
3. Approve connection in MetaMask
4. System should automatically:
   - Add MegaETH network if not present
   - Switch to MegaETH network
   - Display your wallet address and balance

### Test Algorithm Selection
1. Navigate to Dashboard > Create Lab
2. Browse through 8 quantum algorithms
3. Click on any algorithm card
4. See the QASM code generated automatically
5. Submit the job to execute on quantum hardware

### Expected Behavior
- Smooth animations throughout
- Clear visual feedback on selections
- Responsive design on all screen sizes
- Persistent wallet connection across page refreshes
- Automatic network switching when needed

## Browser Compatibility

Tested and working on:
- Chrome/Brave (with MetaMask)
- Firefox (with MetaMask)
- Edge (with MetaMask)
- Safari (limited Web3 support)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Add more advanced quantum algorithms (VQE, QAOA)
- Circuit visualization before execution
- Algorithm parameter customization
- Quantum simulation preview
- Historical job comparison
- Multi-wallet connection support
